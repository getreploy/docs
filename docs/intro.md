## What is Reploy?
Reploy configures and manages remote resources for developer environments without compromising unique local workflows. This allows developers to move faster on building product rather than fighting fires fixing their dev environments.

Reploy provides consistency across developers and their environments (i.e. no more "...but it works on my machine"), moves code execution to the cloud, and yields a bunch of additional advantages like easier collaboration and seamless onboarding among others. The best part about this is that it takes a couple of seconds to get set up, and it does not interfere with any of your local existing workflows that you already love (IDEs, Editors, CI/CD workflows, dev tools, etc.).

<!-- ## Why use Reploy?

Regardless of the size of your organization, Reploy will prove to be immensely helpful:

1. Set it up just once. Not once per developer.

2. 

If you don't think these are important, consider asking your developers. -->
